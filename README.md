KortexFlow- So, I've got this idea for an app I'm going to build. You know how my inbox is a total mess and I'm always worried I'm missing stuff? My plan is to create a personal dashboard that connects to my Gmail and Calendar. It'll use AI to automatically read my emails, figure out what's actually a task or a meeting, and then just put it on a simple to-do list for me. Basically, instead of me digging through emails, this thing will just tell me, 'Hey, you need to do this by Wednesday,' or 'You have a meeting to confirm for Friday.' It's like building my own personal assistant to finally get my life organized.
