# KortexFlow – Workflows You Can Trust

Are you tired of juggling reminders, deadlines, and workplace tasks across five different apps and losing track of which update happened where? KortexFlow was designed for real teams and individuals who believe digital productivity should be simple, open, and documented—not mysterious or locked away.

***
## The Problem (The "Why")
The modern inbox is a chaotic, overwhelming to-do list. We are constantly losing critical tasks and deadlines buried in email threads, leading to lost time and missed opportunities.

## The Solution (The "What")
KortexFlow is an AI-powered personal assistant that transforms your digital life into a clear, actionable plan. It automatically connects to your Gmail and Calendar, uses advanced AI to extract tasks and events, and presents them in a single, distraction-free dashboard.

## Purpose of using KortexFlow (The Idea):

We set out to build a tool where every action is visible and accountable. With KortexFlow, you don’t just get another dashboard; you get easy connections between your inbox, calendar, and wallet, with everything tracked securely on the Algorand blockchain. This means every completed task, deadline met, or change in workflow is written to an open ledger. No hiding—every step is permanent and reviewable.

## Installation Quickstart

You only need the basics: Node.js 18+, pnpm, Git, and a Supabase account. Here’s how you get started:

- Clone the repository:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kortexflow.git
  cd kortexflow
  ```
- Install what you need:
  ```
  pnpm install
  ```
- Add your config to `.env.local` (Supabase keys and Algorand network info).
- Run:
  ```
  pnpm dev
  ```
  Open your browser—and your workflow is clear and ready at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

For public launch, push to GitHub and link to Vercel, then add your secrets in the dashboard.

## Blockchain-Backed Actions

Why trust a dashboard to tell you what’s done? With KortexFlow, every change is a blockchain transaction—visible on AlgoExplorer and impossible to erase or fake. The smart contract code lives in `lib/algorand`. You can always trace, verify, and audit your own progress from day one.

## How It’s Built

KortexFlow uses simple tech to empower users:
- Next.js and Vite for a fast, reliable dashboard
- Supabase for secure data management and login
- Algorand for permanent, transparent tracking of every change
- Vercel deploys everything with a click

You don’t need to understand blockchain to benefit—but if you do, you’ll appreciate the security.
